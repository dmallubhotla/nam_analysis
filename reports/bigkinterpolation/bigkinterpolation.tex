	\section{Interpolated dielectric constant} \label{sec:bigkinterpolation}

	As we saw in the earlier notes on the noise values, the $k$ dependence of the response function $\epsilon_{AN}$(the Approximated Nam) in~\cite{Nam1967} are fairly well approximated with a piecewise function:
	\begin{equation}
		\epsilon_{AN}(u) =
		\begin{cases}
			-a + i b & u < u_c \\
			1 + \frac{-c + i d}{u} & u \geq u_c
		\end{cases},
	\end{equation} \label{eq:epsAN}
	where $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are real and positive (and are determined by the frequency) and $u_c$ is a cutoff value on the order of the impurity spacing.
	This approximates Nam's $\epsilon$ well for $u \ll u_c$ and $u \gg u_c$, and is somewhat less accurate very close to $u_c$.
	For the values mentioned in the other notes for lead, fitting the numerical integration gives
	\begin{align}
		a &= 3.81 \times 10^{11} \\
		b &= 3.24 \times 10^{9} \\
		c &= 2.67 \times 10^{19} \\
		d &= 2.29 \times 10^{17} \\
		u_c &= 7 \times 10^{7}
	\end{align}.

	This is all well below the Fermi wave vector, which in these units is on the order of $u_F \sim 10^{15}$.
	In order to incorporate that, we might consider forcing the dielectric constant to manually match the normal metal above some value.
	For a normal metal, for sufficiently large $u$,
	\begin{equation}
		\epsilon_{TF} = 1 + \flatfrac{u_{TF}^2}{u^2} \label{eq:epsTF},
	\end{equation}
	where $u_{TF}$ is of the same order as $u_F$.\todo{cite this}
	We would expect~\eqref{eq:epsAN} to fail at some point approaching $u_F$, and at that scale it's numerically clear that we won't be able to smoothly join this with~\eqref{eq:epsTF}.
	The salient features of this expansion are that above some critical $u$ the imaginary part of $\epsilon$ goes to zero, so we might consider forcing $\epsilon$ above $u_F$ to follow
	\begin{equation}
		\epsilon(u > u_F) = 1 + \frac{-c u_F}{u^2},
	\end{equation}
	which will smoothly join with~\eqref{eq:epsAN} and replicates the $u^{-2}$ dependence for the real part of $\epsilon$.
	Alternatively, we can just use a piecewise form
	\begin{equation}
		\epsilon_f(u) =
		\begin{cases}
			-a + i b & u < u_c \\
			1 + \frac{-c + i d}{u} &  u_F \geq u \geq u_c \\
			1 + \frac{u_{TF}^2}{u} &  u \geq u_F
		\end{cases},
	\end{equation} \label{eq:epsForced}
	It turns out that both options are reasonably similar when going through the surface impedance calculations, so I'll use~\eqref{eq:epsForced} for these notes.

	\section{Plots of noise integrand} \label{sec:plotsdiscussion}

	For all of these values, above $u > u_F$ the value of $\Im r_p(u)$ becomes identically zero.
	This does make the function converge, however, there isn't unfortunately a natural choice for $u_F$.

		\caption{$\Im[rp(u)]$ for different cutoff $u_F$} \label{fig:imrpVsCutoff}
	\end{figure}

	We see \fref{fig:imrpVsCutoff} the effect of various cutoff values.
	We would expect that $u_F$, as suggested by its name, should be around the Fermi surface, but we see that even slight changes have a big impact in the actual integrand.
	As discussed elsewhere, the noise should converge for $z\rightarrow 0$, and this corresponds to
	\begin{equation}
		\chi_{EE}(z = 0) \propto \int_0^\infty \dd{u} u^2 Im[r_p(u)].
	\end{equation}

	\begin{figure}[htp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=14cm]{imrp1}
		\caption{$u^2 \Im[rp(u)]$ for different cutoff $u_F$} \label{fig:u2imrpVsCutoff}
	\end{figure}
	The integrand, $\u^2 Im[r_p(u)]$, is plotted in \fref{fig:u2imrpVsCutoff}.
	Unfortunately, it's clear that the value of the integral is strongly dependent on the specific value of the cutoff $u_F$, which makes it hard to find a natural value using heuristic arguments.
